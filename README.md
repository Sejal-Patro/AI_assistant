In this project, you will design and implement a basic AI Assistant that can perform a variety
of tasks based on user prompts. This project will allow you to showcase your skills in crafting
effective prompts and understanding how different prompts can drive various responses from
an AI model.
Project: Build Your Own AI Assistant
Your task is to create a command-line or web-based AI Assistant capable of performing tasks
such as answering questions, providing summaries, generating text, or offering suggestions
based on user input.
Requirements:
1. Functionality:
o Your AI Assistant should be able to perform at least three distinct functions.
Examples include:
▪ Answering factual questions (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")
▪ Summarizing a given text or article.
▪ Generating creative content (e.g., stories, poems, or essays).
▪ Providing advice on a specific topic (e.g., "What are some tips for studying
effectively?").
2. Prompt Design:
o For each function, design at least three different prompts that effectively guide the
AI in generating the desired output. Consider varying:
▪ Length and specificity.
▪ Tone and style.
▪ Complexity and context.
3. User Interaction:
o Implement a user-friendly interface (command-line or simple web app) where users
can:
▪ Input their queries or commands.
▪ Choose which function they want the assistant to perform.
▪ Receive and view responses clearly.
4. Feedback Loop:
o Include a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the responses. For example:
▪ "Was this response helpful? (yes/no)"
▪ Use this feedback to refine the prompt design or suggest improvements in
the AI's responses.# AI_assistant
